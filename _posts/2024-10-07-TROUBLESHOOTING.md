# Troubleshooting Methodology

1. Identify the problem

   - Ask questions to the users for gathering information. Such as, What happened?, What was the status before?, What was the status after?, Is there any change in the system?

2. Establish a theory of probable cause

   - Question the obvious things
   - Look up the problem using external research/documentation (Internet)
   - Look up the problem using Internal research/documentation (System)

3. Test the theory to determine the cause

   - Go back to steps 1 to three if the theory is not correct

4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects

5. Implement the solution or escalate as necessary

6. Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventative measures

7. Document findings, actions, outcomes, and lesson learned

# Troubleshooting Tools

## Hardware Tools

1. Snips/Cutters : Used to cut cables from a spool, including twisted-pair copper, coaxial, or large cable bundles.

2. Cable Strippers : Removes the outer jacket of the cable to expose wires for connector attachment, like RJ45 for Ethernet or RG6 for coaxial.

3. Cable Crimpers : Attaches connectors (RJ45, RJ11 for Ethernet; RG6, RG59 for coaxial) to cables.

4. Cable Testers : Verifies the continuity and pinout configuration of each wire in the cable to ensure proper connection (e.g., straight-through or crossover cables).

5. Wire Maps : Diagnoses issues in Ethernet cables, such as open, shorted, or cross pairs.

6. Cable Certifiers : Determines the category and data throughput of cables (Cat5, Cat6, etc.) and provides information like cable length and resistance.

7. Multimeters : Measures voltage, resistance, and amperage in cables to check for breaks or test power outlets.

8. Punch Down Tools : Used for terminating cables on punch-down blocks (e.g., 66 or 110 blocks).

9. Tone Generators : Helps identify cable runs by generating a tone that is detected at the other end, useful for tracing cables.

10. Loopback Adapters : Creates a loop in the network for testing connectivity by connecting transmit and receive pins.

11. Time-Domain Reflectometers (TDR) : Locates breaks in copper cables and measures the distance to the fault.

12. Optical Time-Domain Reflectometers (OTDR) : Similar to TDR, but used for fiber optic cables to detect breaks and measure light loss.

13. Fiber Light Meters : Measures how effectively a fiber cable transmits light, using LEDs for multimode and lasers for single-mode fibers.

14. Fusion Splicers : Joins fiber optic cables by fusing the fibers together.

## Software Tools

1. Wi-Fi analyzer : Used to conduct wireless surveys to ensure proper coverage and to prevent non-desired overlap between wireless access point coverage zones and channels

2. Protocol analyzer and packet capture : Protocol analyzer is used to capture and analyze signals and data traffic over a communication channel and Packet Capturing Tool is used to capture packets running over a network connection in real time and save for later analysis

3. Bandwidth speed test : Verifies the real-world throughput from a client device all the way out to the Internet and back

4. Port scanner : Determines which ports are open on a network

5. NetFlow analyzer : Performs monitoring, troubleshooting and in-depth inspection, interpretation, and synthesis of traffic flow data

6. IP scanner : Used to search for and detect IP addresses and other information related to devices on the network
