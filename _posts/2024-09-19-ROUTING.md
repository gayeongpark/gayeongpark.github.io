# Routing

Router (Multi-layer switch or layer 3 switch) forwards traffic between subnets, between an internal and external network, or between two external networks. It is the layer 3 device.

Each subnet or external network is going to be its own broadcast domain

## Routing fundamentals

A router's main function is to route traffic between different subnets, networks, or between an internal and external network. It operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and forwards packets based on IP addresses, as opposed to switches, which operate at Layer 2 and forward frames based on MAC addresses.

Routing involves transitions between Layer 2 (data frames) and Layer 3 (network packets). Routers use MAC addresses within the local network (Layer 2) and IP addresses to forward traffic across networks (Layer 3).

### Routing processes

When PC1 wants to send data to PC2 (on a different subnet), it sends an ARP request to find the MAC address of its default gateway (the router).
The router responds with its MAC address, and PC1 forwards the data frame to the router.

Once the router receives the data frame, it checks where PC2 is located by looking at its IP address, repackages the Layer 2 data frame into a Layer 3 network IP packet, and forwards it across the network.

On the receiving end, Router 2 strips the IP packet back down to a Layer 2 frame, adding the MAC address of PC2 and sending the frame to its destination on the local network.

## Routing Tables

### How does a router make its routing decisions?

Router uses a routing table just like our switches used a mac address table or a cam table. Routing table helps determine which route entry is the best fit for the network. A route entry has a prefix, and the longer the prefix is, the more specific that network is.

`10.1.1.0/24` is more specific than `10.0.0.0/8`

### Three different sources routers are going to use

- **Directly Connected Route** is learned by a physical connection between two routers.

- **Static Route** is manually configured by an administrator. There is always one default static route in every router, and it is a special one. It is known as `0.0.0.0/0`.

- **Dynamic Route** is learned by exchanging information between routers.

### How to prevent routing loops?

- **Split Horizon** is to prevent a route learned on one interface from being advertised back out of that same interface.

- **Poison Reverse** is going to cause a route that's received on one interface to be advertised back out of that same interface with a metric considered to be infinite.

## Routing Protocols

### Two different types of dynamic routing protocols

- **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)** operates within an autonomous system.

- **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)** operates between autonomous systems.

Router Advertisement Method is a characteristic of every routing protocol to share routes.

- Distance Vector : Routes are determined based on the number of hops (routers) between the source and destination. This method has a slow convergence time. One of the way to speed up the convergence time is to actually use a hold-down timer. It prevents updates for a specific period of time and speeds up convergence.

  - Convergence is the time it takes for all of the routers to update their routing tables.

  - Hope Count is te number of routers a packet passes through.

- Link State : Routes are determined based on speed and bandwidth. It has a faster convergence and uses link speed to decide the best path. It requires all routers to know about the paths that all other routers can reach in the network.

  - Link Cost determines the best path based on speed, rather than hop count.

### Routing Protocols

1. RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

   - Type: Distance Vector (Interior)
   - Characteristics: Sends updates every 30 seconds. Maximum hop count of 15. Slow convergence.
   - Usage: Older protocol; easy to configure.

2. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

   - Type: Link State (Interior)
   - Characteristics: Uses cost based on link speed rather than hop count. Provides faster convergence.
   - Usage: Commonly used in large networks.

3. IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)

   - Type: Link State (Interior)
   - Characteristics: Similar to OSPF but less widely adopted.

4. EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

   - Type: Hybrid (Distance Vector + Link State) (Interior)
   - Characteristics: Uses both bandwidth and delay metrics. Proprietary to Cisco.
   - Usage: Popular in Cisco environments.

5. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**

   - Type: Exterior Gateway Protocol (Exterior)
   - Characteristics: Routes based on autonomous system paths rather than individual routers. Backbone of the internet. Slow convergence.
   - Usage: Manages routing between ISPs and large-scale networks.

## Route Selection

Believability of a Route

Lower AD (Administrative Distance) is considered more believable or trustworthy.

    Routing Information Source | Administrative Distance
    Directly Connected Network | 0
    Statically Connected Network | 1
    EIGRP | 90
    OSPF | 110
    RIP | 120
    External EIGRP | 170
    Unknown or Unbelievable | 255 (unreachable)

**Hop Count**

Least number of hops gives less distance to cover.

**Bandwidth**

Lowest cost of bandwidth means the highest amount of bandwidth to use.

**Delay**

Least amount of delay.

**Believability**

Lowest number is the most believable.

## Address Translation

Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) help conserve public IPv4 addresses by allowing multiple devices on a private network to access the internet using a limited number of public IPs.

- NAT (Network Address Translation) is used to conserve the limited supply of IPv4 addresses. NAT translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses for routing over public networks.

  - DNAT (Dynamic NAT) automatically assigns an IP address from a pool of public IP addresses and temporarily gives one of the public IPs to the device for the duration of the session. After the session ends, the public IP is returned to the pool for other devices to use.

  - SNAT (Static NAT) manually assigns an IP address and gives a one-to-one translation. SNAT is used as a security feature. A device’s private IP address is permanently mapped to a specific public IP address. This is usually used for devices like servers that always need to be accessible from the internet.

  Inside local | Private IP address referencing an inside device | Local device's private IP address

  Inside global | Public IP address referencing an inside device | Router's public IP address

  Outside local | Private IP address referencing an outside device | The router assigns a private IP to the website

  Outside global | Public IP address referencing an outside device | The public IP of the website or server I am connecting to

- PAT (Port Address Translation) is sharing of one public IP by multiple private IP addresses which gives a many-to-one translation. PAT lets multiple devices share a single public IP by using port numbers to distinguish between their requests and responses. It’s what makes our home network work with just one public IP address

For example,

When I connect my laptop to my home Wi-Fi, DHCP assigns my laptop a private IP, like 192.168.1.10.

When I browse the internet, NAT or PAT on my router translates this private IP to a public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1) so I can communicate with websites.

## Routing Redundancy Protocols

Routing Redundancy Protocol is a network protocol that prevents disruptions in communication by automatically rerouting data traffic in case of a path or device failure.

- First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) is a set of protocols designed to ensure network reliability by providing automatic failover to a backup router to maintain uninterrupted network service. It is able to determine when a primary router fails, and then they will immediately direct the packets to a standby router.

  Three main benefits

  - Reliability because it ensures that communications remain up and running even if a single router configuration fails.

  - Load balancing because it distributes network traffic across multiple routers to prevent any single device from being overwhelmed.

  - Seamless transitions because it sends data from a failed router to redirect to a standby router.

In order to make the First Hop Router Redundancy Protocol work, we are going to rely on two critical components.

- Virtual IP (default gateway) is the IP address that is not bound to a specific device but serves as a representative for one or multiple devices.

- Sub-interface is designed to allow a single physical interface on a router or a switch to be subdivided into multiple logical interfaces. Sub-interfaces are cost-efficient and help conduct traffic management.

### Three Key Routing Redundancy Protocols

1. Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)

   - Developed by Cisco.
   - One active router handles traffic, while a standby router takes over if the active router fails.
   - Features a preempting mechanism for higher-priority routers to take control.

2. Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)

   - Open standard (not tied to Cisco).
   - Works similarly to HSRP but allows for wider compatibility across different vendors.
   - Automatically assigns one primary router, with others in standby.

3. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)

   - Also developed by Cisco.
   - Adds load balancing to redundancy by distributing traffic among multiple routers.
   - Each router shares traffic load via different Virtual MAC addresses, increasing efficiency while ensuring redundancy.

## Multicast Routing

Multicast router sends traffic to a Class D IP address, known as a multicast group.

### Ways to do the multicast routing

1. **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)** is used by clients and routers to let the routers know which interfaces have multicast receivers and allow clients to join a multicast group.

   - IGMPv1 : Client requests joining the group and is asked every 60 seconds if it wants to remain in the group

   - IGMPv2 : Client can send a leave message to exit multicast group

   - IGMPv3 : Client can request multicast only from specific server and allows source-specific multicast (SSM) and multiple video streams to a single multicast stream.

2. **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)** routes multicast traffic between routers and forms a multicast distribution tree.

   - Dense Mode (PIM-DM) uses periodic flood and prune behavior to form optimal distribution tree. In modern network, people do not use it.

   - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) uses a shared distribution tree and creates an optimal distribution tree through shortest path tree (SPT) switchover. In the modern network, PIM-SM is used.

## Generic Routing Encapsulation

**Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)** is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol network. GRE operates at the network layer of the OSI model and is configured on network routers.
GRE serves as a universal translator for different protocols, enabling them to communicate over a shared network infrastructure, particularly useful in connecting heterogeneous networks. For example, GRE can link multiple branch offices over the internet without the need for expensive dedicated leased lines, encapsulating and isolating data to maintain integrity and confidentiality. While a VPN offers robust security features, GRE is ideal for encapsulating data efficiently. For enhanced security, GRE can be combined with VPN technology. GRE is suitable for connecting remote sites, facilitating data exchange, and integrating disparate network protocols within organizations.
