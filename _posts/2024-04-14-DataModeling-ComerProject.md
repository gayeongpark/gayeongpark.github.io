## User Case (Entities)

1. **Users:**

   They have the capability to create an account, view booked experiences, and access their previously opened events. Users can also edit their profiles. They also can find forgot password and reset the password. They cannot save previously saved password, so it should not be matched with the current password and old one. To sign up, individuals must provide an email address, create a password, and confirm that password again. Upon submitting this information, they will receive an email containing a verification token. This token is appended to a URL(user will be redirected to this url address); clicking on the hyperlinked URL in the email activates the user's account, allowing them to participate in any desired activities on the website. If users complete to verify their email addresses, the email token string will change from a string to a null value. Additionally, users can reset their passwords once their email addresses are found in the database. In this situation, emailToken will be issued. Once user click the url sent to their email address, the emailToken will be changed into null. And then user can reset the password, which should not be matched with the previously saved password. Finally, users can delete their accounts, which will change their isActive status to false, not deleting whole data.

2. **Experiences:**

   Users can create/edit events. They can upload image files, which are stored on AWS S3 bucket. The event details, including title, description, perks (such as food, beverages, transportation, equipment, and others), guest requirements (minimum age, allowance of kids and pets, maximum group size), languages spoken, general availability (start time, end time, date range), tags, price with currency, additional notes for consideration by users, likes from other users, and cancellation policy, are stored in the database. To facilitate event location, information such as country, city, state, address (including street number), longitude, latitude, coordinates, and full address are also stored in the database. These location details are provided via the Mapbox library from the client side. If users want to edit events, they can revise the information only what they want to edit, not inputting all information. User can search events by city name.

3. **Comments:**

   Users are able to create and delete comments on the detailed event pages. An experience page may contain multiple comments. When a comment is posted, the user ID and experience ID are stored as foreign keys, along with the comment's description.

4. **Availabilities:**

   When a user opens their event, an availability entity is created based on data from the start time, end time, and date range (Experience entity). This entity includes the experience ID as a foreign key, dateMaxGuestPairs, booking information (to track who booked the event), and a timestamp. Within the dateMaxGuestPairs, objects are stored that include details such as the date, start time, end time, maximum number of guests allowed, price, and current status. When an event is booked by a user, the number of maximum guests allowed is accordingly decreased. In addition to it, an object (including date, slotId, userId, experienceId, experienceTitle, UserEmail, startTime, endTime) will be created in the availabilities.booking array.
