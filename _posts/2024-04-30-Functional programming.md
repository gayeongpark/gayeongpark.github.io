## What is functional programming?

- It is a declarative programming paradigm style and takes an input value and produces an output value.

- It is an immutable data structures and algorithms.

- It is higher-order functions.

## what is declarative vs imperative programming?

- Imperative programming describes a step-by-step process for a program's execution, detailing the steps required to solve a problem. (such as Object-Oriented Programming)

- In the declarative paradigm, I need to define the results I want a program to accomplish without describing its control flow. (such as Functional Programming)

- JavaScript is supporting both paradigms, declarative and imperative programming.

- Python is considered an imperative programming language.

## What is immutability in functional programming?

- Once a variable is assigned a value, that value cannot be changed throughout the course of its existence. In short, data structures, once created, cannot be changed.

```javascript
function incrementAge(user) {
  return { ...user, age: user.age + 1 };
}

const originalUser = { name: "Mark", age: 25 };
const newUser = incrementAge(originalUser);

console.log(originalUser); // {name: "Mark", age: 25}
console.log(newUser); // {name: "Mark", age: 26}
```

Here, `incrementAge` returns a new user object with the age property incremented, leaving the original `originalUser` object unmodified.

Let's look at my source code where I used immutability concept.

![immutabilitymycode](/assets/img/functionalProgramming/immutable.png)

I used React's `useState` hook to manage component state updating state variables immutably.

To explain with my source code(client side),

First, the `useState` hook initializes the `perks` state as an object with multiple properties, each representing a different category and initially set to an empty string.

```javascript
const [perks, setPerks] = useState({
  food: "",
  transportation: "",
  beverage: "",
  alcohol: "",
  equipment: "",
  others: "",
});
```

Second, the `handlePerksChange` function is designed to update the `perks` state when a change event occurs from the input field.

```javascript
const handlePerksChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  // In the line 66, it extracts the `name` and `value` from the event's target from the input field. The `name` corresponds to the specific perk being updated, and `value` is the new value for that perk.
  setPerks((prevPerks) => ({
    // `setPerks` is called with a function as its argument rather than a direct new state value. This function receives the previous state as its parameter.
    ...prevPerks,
    // Here is where immutability is applied.
    // `...prevPerks` creates a new object that is a shallow copy of `prevPerks`. By spreading `prevPerks`, all existing properties and their values are included in the new state object, ensuring that I am building on the latest state without mutating it.
    [name]: value,
    // This syntax dynamically updates the property of the object that corresponds to the input's name attribute.
    // The property's value is set to the new value from the input.
    // This part of the expression is key to immutability because it doesn't alter an existing property directly; instead, it specifies the updated value in the new object being created.
  }));
};

## Functional Programming Concepts

### Pure functions

It always **returns the same output from the given input (name) without causing any side effects**. So the output can be **predictable** and easily understandable.

#### What is referential transparent expression

It is a expression that referentially transparent, if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This property is a direct consequence of using pure functions.

```javascript
// Pure function
function greet(name) {
  return `Hi, ${name}`;
}
// Referential transparent expression
console.log(greet("lantana"));
// Hi, lantana
```

However, the code below is **not** pure function because `count` was declared outside of the function, it can draw modification from the external state. So, the function is mutability.

```javascript
let count = 10;

function addToCount(num) {
  count += num;
}

console.log(addToCount(5)); // 15
```

### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are functions without a name. They are really useful when I need a quick small function without specifying the function name. These functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions, for event handling.

#### What is Lambda expression?

It is a concise way to represent an anonymous function. It can be expressed using `lambda` keyword in Python and arrow functions in JavaScript

```python
def cube(y):
    return y*y*y

lambda_cube = lambda y: y*y*y
print("Using function defined with `def` keyword, cube:", cube(5)) # Using function defined with `def` keyword, cube: 125
print("Using lambda function, cube:", lambda_cube(5)) # Using lambda function, cube: 125
```

I declared `lambda` keyword function and `def` keyword function to compare.

```javascript
const double = (x) => x * 2;
console.log(double(4)); // 8
```

I just declared a variable, called `double` and then declared a simple arrow function.

### Higher Order Functions

Higher-order functions are a concept in functional programming. They are functions that can **take other functions as arguments** or **return a function as their results**. It characteristic allows for a higher level of abstraction in programming, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

Thus, Functions can be reused in different contexts by encapsulating common function operations or behaviors.

- In javaScript, `map` is a higher-order function that transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and returning a new array with the results.

![map](/assets/img/functionalProgramming/functor-example.jpg)

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squares = numbers.map((x) => x * x); // Applying a function to square each element
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

- `filter` is another higher-order function that takes another function as an argument.

  In my code example,

  ```javascript
  {
    bookings.map((bookingGroup, groupIndex) => (
      <article key={groupIndex}>
        {bookingGroup.booking
          .filter((booking) => booking.userEmail === authUser.email)
          .map((booking, index) => (
            <div
              key={index}
              className="flex justify-between mx-auto max-w-2xl p-5 ring-1 ring-gray-200 sm:mt-20 lg:mx-0 lg:flex lg:max-w-none"
            >
              <p className="flex text-xl items-center justify-center">
                {booking.date.split("T")[0]}
              </p>
              <p className="flex text-lg items-center justify-center">
                {booking.startTime} - {booking.endTime}
              </p>
              <Link to={`/product/${booking.experienceId}`}>
                <p className="flex text-2xl items-center justify-center">
                  {booking.experienceTitle}
                </p>
              </Link>
              <div>
                <button
                  className="flex rounded-md border border-transparent bg-red-700 px-6 py-2 text-md font-medium text-white shadow-sm        hover:bg-red-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-red-500 focus:ring-offset-2"
                  onClick={() => cancelBooking(booking._id)}
                >
                  Cancel booking
                </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          ))}
      </article>
    ));
  }
  ```

  The `filter` function is used inside the arrow function passed to the `map` function. Inside the `map` function, for each `bookingGroup`, the `filter` function is applied to the `bookingGroup.booking` array. And then these functions return a subset result from the origin value.

- `reduce` method is a higher-order function. It operates on arrays and **takes a callback function as an argument**, applying this callback to reduce the array to a single value.

  ```javascript
  let numbers = [5, 20, 100, 60, 1];
  const maxValue = numbers.reduce((max, curr) => {
    if (curr > max) max = curr;
    return max;
  });
  console.log(numbers); // [5, 20, 100, 60, 1]
  console.log(maxValue); // 100
  ```

To explain with my source code,

in this express.js server code, middleware functions are used to process requests. The `authenticateUser` middleware checks if the user is authenticated before processing to the route handler. Middleware functions in this code below are higher-order functions because they take three arguments: `req` (the request object), `res` (the response object), and `next` (a function to call the next middleware in the stack).

The `next` argument is particularly significant because it is a function and allows `authenticateUser` to control the flow of the application by deciding whether to proceed to the next piece of middleware in the stack or terminate the chain based on authentication logic. Since `next` function has the potential to call this function depending on the outcome of its internal logic, the ability to take and invoke functions makes middleware inherently higher-order.

The authentication logic is encapsulated in authenticateUser, making it reusable across different routes.

```javascript
// middleware
const authenticateUser = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const authAccessToken = req.cookies["accessToken"];
    if (!authAccessToken) {
      return res.status(401).json("Access token not found!");
    }

    const payload = jwt.verify(authAccessToken, process.env.ACCESS_SECRET);

    if (!payload) {
      return res.status(401).json("Unauthorized!");
    }

    const user = await User.findById(payload.id);
    if (!user || (!user.isVerified && !user.isActive)) {
      return res.status(401).json("Unauthorized!");
    }

    req.user = user;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
```

Additionally, in the route handler `router.get("/:id", authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {})`, the use of `authenticateUser` as middleware before the asynchronous route handler also illustrates the use of higher-order functions. The middleware pre-processes the request, applying authentication logic, before passing control to the route handler.

```javascript
// server code to get an authenticated user profile data
router.get("/:id", authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);

    if (!user) {
      return res.status(404).json("User not found");
    }

    if (user.id !== req.user.id) {
      return res.status(404).json("User not found");
    }

    res.status(200).json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Server Error!" });
  }
});
```

### Currying

Currying is a functional programming concept where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of nested functions, each taking a single argument. For example, `function (a, b, c)` can be `function (a) (b) (c)`.

```javascript
// The function applyShipCost takes three arguments sequentially, country, flatRate, order
// According to the variable, named 'applyShippingToUSA', 'USA' for the country and '10' for the flat rate are assigned to the    'applyShippingCost' function.
// However, this does not execute the final function yet. Instead, it creates a new function, 'applyShippingToUSA'.
const applyShippingCost = (country) => (flatRate) => (order) => {
  // Since 'USA' from order object === 'USA' the argument value assigned at first
  if (order.shipTo === country) {
    return {
      ...order,
      // copy the created order object
      shippingCost: flatRate,
      // add these key and value in the object
    };
  }
  return order;
  // return the order object
};

const applyShippingToUSA = applyShippingCost("USA")(10);
const order = { item: "Book", shipTo: "USA", price: 15 };
console.log(applyShippingToUSA(order));
// {item: "Book", shipTo: "USA", price: 15, shippingCost: 10}
```

### Recursion

It is the concept of a function calling itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar tasks.

```javascript
const buildHierarchy = (employees, managerId) => {
  let hierarchy = {};
  employees
    .filter((employee) => employee.managerId === managerId)
    .forEach((employee) => {
      hierarchy[employee.id] = {
        ...employee,
        reports: buildHierarchy(employees, employee.id),
      };
    });
  return hierarchy;
};

// Sample data
const employees = [
  { id: "1", name: "CEO", managerId: null },
  { id: "2", name: "CTO", managerId: "1" },
  { id: "3", name: "CFO", managerId: "1" },
  { id: "4", name: "Engineer", managerId: "2" },
  { id: "5", name: "Accountant", managerId: "3" },
  { id: "6", name: "Tech Lead", managerId: "2" },
];

// Usage
const companyHierarchy = buildHierarchy(employees, null);
console.log(companyHierarchy);
```

### Functors

It has a container that holds a value and provides a way to apply a function to that value without modifying the container's structure. Any type that has a map function can be functor.

In this code example, by defining a structure(`createBox`), this function encapsulates a value and provides a `map` to apply transformations to that value, returning a new instance of the structure with the transformed value.

```javascript
// A function that creates a box
const createBox = (value) => ({
  // The map function applies a transformation to the box's value
  map: (fn) => createBox(fn(value)),
  // A utility function to view the value inside the box
  fold: () => value,
});

// Usage
const box = createBox(5)
  .map((value) => value + 2) // Returns a new box with value 7
  .map((value) => value * 2) // Returns a new box with value 14
  .fold(); // Extracts the value from the box

console.log(box); // 14
```

In my code example, I used functor concept like this.

Here, `.map()` is used to transform each comment in the comments array into a JSX element. This transformation is applied without mutating the original comments array, returning a new array of React elements where each element represents a Comment component.

```javascript
<div className="flex-col">
  {comments.map((comment) => (
    <div className="flex-block" key={comment._id}>
      <Comment comment={comment} />
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Monads

It has structures that wrap or encapsulate values just like functors but add an extra layer of functionality, like chaining operation.

One of the key reasons for using monads is to avoid nested structures when chaining operations that return a context (like arrays or promises).

The code demonstrates chaining asynchronous operations using Promises, where `jwtInterceptor.get()` returns a Promise. This promise is then chained with `.then()` for the next operation on the successful response and `.catch()` for error handling. This chaining and handling of asynchronous operations without deeply nested callbacks illustrate the monadic property of handling side effects in a clean, functional manner.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Define the fetchData function using promise chaining
  function fetchData() {
    jwtInterceptor
      .get("/experiences", {
        headers: { "content-Type": "application/json" },
        withCredentials: true,
      })
      .then((response) => {
        // Directly handling the transformation of the response data
        const products = response.data;
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Handle any errors that occur during fetching or transformation
        console.error("Fetching error:", error);
      });
  }

  // Invoke fetchData to perform the operation
  fetchData();
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once on mount
```
